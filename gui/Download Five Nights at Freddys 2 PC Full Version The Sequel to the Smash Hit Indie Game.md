However, unlike the first game, you don't have any doors to close or power to conserve. Instead, you have a Freddy Fazbear mask that you can wear to fool some of the animatronics into thinking you are one of them. But not all of them will fall for it, and some of them will be more aggressive and unpredictable than others.
 
You have to survive five nights of increasing difficulty, from 12 AM to 6 AM. Each night, you will face different animatronics, both old and new, that have different behaviors and patterns. You will also receive phone calls from a previous security guard who will give you some tips and information about the place and the animatronics.
 
## What are some tips and tricks for Five Nights at Freddy's 2?
 
Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is a game that can be very challenging and scary, especially for beginners. Here are some tips and tricks that might help you beat the game:

- Wear headphones - Recognizing and reacting to audio cues is key to surviving Five Nights at Freddy's 2. You can hear the animatronics moving in the vents, banging on the doors, or speaking in the hallway. You can also hear the music box winding down or the puppet's music playing.
- Listen to Phone Guy's messages - Hello hello? Phone Guy is your only friend in this game, and he will give you some useful advice and information about the place and the animatronics. Pay attention to what he says and follow his instructions.
- Something peering at you from the vent? - If you see an animatronic in your vent, put on your mask right away. They will eventually leave if they think you are one of them. However, some of them might come out and stare at you for a while before going back. Don't take off your mask until they are gone.
- If you see the animatronics down the hallway, you're not in danger - yet - In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the security office faces a long hallway. You can use your flashlight to check if there are any animatronics there. However, they won't attack you from there, unless they are Foxy or Mangle. They will only enter your office through the vents or by jumping on your desk.
- Keep the music box running - The music box is located in the Prize Room (Camera 11), and it keeps a puppet-like animatronic from escaping its box. You have to wind it up every once in a while by switching to its camera and holding down a button. If you let it run out, you will hear a jack-in-the-box music for a bit, then you will get jumpscared by the puppet.

These are just some of the tips and tricks for Five Nights at Freddy's 2. There are more things to learn and discover as you play the game. Good luck and have fun!
