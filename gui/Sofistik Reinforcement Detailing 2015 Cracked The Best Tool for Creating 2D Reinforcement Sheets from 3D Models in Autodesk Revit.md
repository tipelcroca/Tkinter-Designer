SOFiSTiK Reinforcement Detailing 2015 is a software product that allows you to create 2D reinforcement sheets from 3D models in Autodesk Revit. It includes a set of families that can be customized to meet your standards and preferences. It also enables you to generate bar lists, bending schedules and cut lists for wire meshes.
 
However, this software is not free and requires a valid license to run. If you want to use it without paying for it, you might be tempted to look for a cracked version online. A cracked version is a modified version of the software that bypasses the license verification process and allows you to use it illegally.

While cracking software might seem like an easy and convenient way to save money, it also comes with many risks and disadvantages. Here are some of the reasons why you should avoid cracking SOFiSTiK Reinforcement Detailing 2015:
 
- It is illegal and unethical. Cracking software is a form of piracy that violates the intellectual property rights of the software developers. It also deprives them of their rightful income and discourages them from creating more quality products. By cracking software, you are breaking the law and exposing yourself to potential legal consequences.
- It is unsafe and unreliable. Cracked software often contains malware, viruses, spyware or other harmful programs that can damage your computer or compromise your data. Cracked software also may not work properly or have missing features or functions. You might encounter errors, crashes, bugs or compatibility issues that can affect your productivity and quality of work.
- It is unsupported and outdated. Cracked software does not receive any updates, patches or fixes from the original developers. This means that you will miss out on any new features, improvements or bug fixes that are released for the software. You will also not be able to access any technical support or customer service from the developers if you encounter any problems or issues with the software.

As you can see, cracking SOFiSTiK Reinforcement Detailing 2015 is not worth it. You will end up risking your computer, your data, your reputation and your legal status for a subpar and unstable product. Instead of cracking software, you should consider buying a legitimate license from the official website of SOFiSTiK or look for alternative solutions that are free or affordable.
  
So, what are some of the alternative solutions that you can use instead of cracking SOFiSTiK Reinforcement Detailing 2015? Here are some of the options that you can explore:

- Use the free trial version. SOFiSTiK offers a free trial version of its software products that you can download and use for a limited time. This way, you can test the software and see if it meets your needs and expectations before buying it. You can also learn how to use the software and get familiar with its features and functions.
- Use the educational version. If you are a student, a teacher or an academic institution, you can apply for an educational license from SOFiSTiK that allows you to use the software for non-commercial purposes. The educational license is valid for one year and can be renewed annually. You can also access online tutorials, webinars and forums to enhance your learning experience.
- Use an alternative software. There are many other software products that can help you with reinforcement detailing and documentation. Some of them are free or open source, while others are paid but cheaper than SOFiSTiK. You can compare the features, functions, prices and reviews of different software products and choose the one that suits your budget and requirements.

In conclusion, cracking SOFiSTiK Reinforcement Detailing 2015 is not a good idea. It is illegal, unsafe, unreliable, unsupported and outdated.
